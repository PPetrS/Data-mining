# Data-mining

Objective: Obtaining data on specific legal entities from the public register and submitting the data in csv format.

The conversion of XML data to CSV format can be done using a script or tool that extracts and transforms data from the XML structure to the CSV table format. The Python programming language was used for the large volume of data using the xml.etree.ElementTree module.

The script is modified according to the structure of the XML file.

Before running the script, testing was performed on a smaller portion of the data to avoid potential problems with large volumes of data.

In XML, namespaces are used to prevent name conflicts by providing a way to uniquely identify elements and attributes within an XML document.
